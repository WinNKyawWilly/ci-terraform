GitOps Workflow Integration
GitOps enables a declarative and version-controlled way of managing infrastructure. Here's how you can leverage it:

1. Store Terraform Code in Git
   Maintain your Terraform configurations (for IAM resources and supporting infrastructure) in a Git repository.
   Use separate branches for staging, production, and testing.
2. Automated Deployment Pipelines
   Use CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or CircleCI to:
   Plan and apply Terraform configurations automatically when changes are pushed to the repository.
   Validate Terraform code with tools like terraform validate or tflint.
3. Sync with Web UI Application
   Include environment configurations in Git (e.g., an S3 bucket for user reports, IAM policy ARNs, or API Gateway details).
   Trigger deployments of your web app when infrastructure changes (e.g., terraform apply creates new resources).
4. Policy Management as Code
   Store and version-control IAM policies in Git to ensure reproducibility and traceability of permissions.
   Use tools like Terraform Sentinel or OPA to enforce policy compliance during CI/CD.
